## Multi-layer perceptrons

* A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) consists of "neurons" arranged in layers.
* A neuron is a mathematical function.  It takes inputs $x_1, \ldots, x_n$, calculates a function $y=f(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ and passes $y$ to the neurons in the next level.
* The inputs in the first layer are the predictors.
* The inputs in successive layers are the calculations from the prior level. 
* The last layer is a single neuron that produces the output.

## Illustration

. . .

::: {layout="[70, 30]"}

![](neuralnet.png)

* inputs $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$
* variables $y_1, \ldots, y_5$  are calculated in hidden layer
* output depends on $y_1, \ldots, y_5$

## Rectified linear units

- The usual function for the neurons (except in the last layer) is 

. . .

$$ y = \max(0,b+w_1x_1 + \cdots + w_nx_n)$$

- Parameters $b$ (called bias) and $w_1, \ldots w_n$ (called weights) are different for different neurons. 
- This function is called a rectified linear unit (RLU).  


## Analogy to neurons firing

- If $w_i>0$ then $y>0$ only when $x_i$ are large enough. 
- A neuron  fires when it is sufficiently stimulated by signals from other neurons (in prior layer).

## Output function

- The output doesn't have an option-like truncation, so it can be negative.
- For regression problems, it is linear:

. . .

$$z = b+w_1y_1 + \cdots + w_ny_n$$ 

- For classification, there is a linear function for each class and the prediction is the class with the largest value.

## Deep learning

- Deep learning means a neural network with  many layers.  It is behind facial recognition, self-driving cars, ...
- Need specialized library, probably TensorFlow (from Google) or PyTorch (from Facebook), 
- and probably need graphical processing units (GPUs) -- i.e., run on video cards,


## Example

- Use roeq and mom12m for 2021-01 as before.
- Predict rnk as before.
- Two hidden layers with 4 nodes in the first and 2 in the second.

## Define and fit model

. . .

```{.p code-line-numbers="1|3-4|6-9|10"}
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

X = data[["roeq", "mom12m"]]
y = data["rnk"]

model = MLPRegressor(
  hidden_layer_sizes=(4, 2),
  random_state=0
)
model.fit(X,y)
```

```{python}
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pymssql
import pandas as pd

server = "mssql-82792-0.cloudclusters.net:16272"
username = "user"
password = "RiceOwls1912" # paste password between quote marks
database = "ghz"

string = "mssql+pymssql://" + username + ":" + password + "@" + server + "/" + database

conn = create_engine(string).connect()

data = pd.read_sql(
    """
    select ticker, date, ret, roeq, mom12m
    from data
    where date='2021-01'
    """, 
    conn
)
data = data.dropna()
data['rnk'] = data.ret.rank(pct=True)

from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor

X = data[["roeq", "mom12m"]]
y = data["rnk"]

model = MLPRegressor(
  hidden_layer_sizes=(4, 2),
  random_state=0
)
_ = model.fit(X,y)
```

#

R-squared:

. . .

```p
model.score(X,y)
```

. . .

```{python}
model.score(X,y)
```

. . .

<br>
A prediction:

. . .

```p
import numpy as np
x = np.array([.1, .4]).reshape(1,2)
model.predict(x)
```

. . .

```{python}
import numpy as np
x = np.array([.1, .4]).reshape(1,2)
model.predict(x)
```

## Sorts

. . .

Sort based on predictions and compute portfolio returns (in sample):

. . .

```p
prnk = model.predict(X)
data['quintile'] = pd.qcut(prnk, 5, labels=range(1,6))
rets = data.groupby('quintile').ret.mean()
rets
```

. . .

```{python}
prnk = model.predict(X)
data['quintile'] = pd.qcut(prnk, 5, labels=range(1,6))
rets = data.groupby('quintile').ret.mean()
rets
```
