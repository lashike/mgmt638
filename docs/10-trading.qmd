## Workflow

- Spreadsheets
  - Positions (initially all zero)
  - Ranks (from train and predict)
  - Prices (most recent stock prices)
- (Positions + Ranks + Prices) $\rightarrow$ Trades 
- (Positions + Trades) $\rightarrow$ updated Positions 

## Initial portfolio

- Cash to invest
- Select numstocks, equal weight (for example)
- From Ranks, get top numstocks
- (cash/numstocks) = $ per stock
- From prices, calculate shares = $ per stock / price
- $\Rightarrow$ Trades $\Rightarrow$ Positions

## Trading

- Update cash = cash + interest
- New Ranks (no longer holding just top stocks)
- New Prices (no longer equally weighted)
- Need to decide how (Positions + Ranks + Prices) $\rightarrow$ Trades

## Possible strategy

- If new rank is below some threshold, sell all shares
- Otherwise, if new weight is above some threshold, sell some shares
- Invest updated cash + proceeds from sales as
  - Start with best stock with no current holding
  - Buy enough shares to hit target weight
  - Then next best stock, etc., until out of cash

## Python digression

- Suppose **ser** is a pandas series.  What is 

 . . .

 ```p
 2*ser
 ```

- What is

. . .

```p
2 > 1
```

 - What is 

. . .

 ```p
 ser > 1
 ```

- If **x** is another pandas series with the same index, what is

. . .

```p
x[ser > 1]
```

#

- What is

. . .

```p
10 if 2 > 1 else 20
```

- If **ser** is a pandas series, what is

. . .

```p
np.where(ser>1, 10, 20)
```

## Example

- 26 stocks in universe.  Current ranks and prices:

. . .

```{.p code-line-numbers="1-2|4-5"}
ranks = pd.read_excel("files/ranks0.xlsx", index_col=0)
ranks = ranks.squeeze()

prices = pd.read_excel("files/prices0.xlsx", index_col=0)
prices = prices.squeeze()
```

- $100,000 to invest, want to hold 5 stocks equally weighted

. . .

```p
equity = cash = 100000
weight = 0.2
```

## Initial portfolio

. . .

```{.p code-line-numbers=1|2|4|5|7|8}
buys = ranks<=5
buyamounts = (weight*equity/prices).astype(int)

trades = np.where(buys, buyamounts, 0)
trades = pd.Series(trades, index=ranks.index)

positions = trades
cash -= (trades*prices).sum()
```

#

Here are the trades:

. . .

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

ranks = pd.read_excel("../files/ranks0.xlsx", index_col=0)
ranks = ranks.squeeze()

prices = pd.read_excel("../files/prices0.xlsx", index_col=0)
prices = prices.squeeze()

equity = cash = 100000
weight = 0.2

buys = ranks<=5
buyamounts = (weight*equity/prices).astype(int)

trades = np.where(buys, buyamounts, 0)
trades = pd.Series(trades, index=ranks.index)

positions = trades
cash -= (trades*prices).sum()
trades
```


## Update ranks, prices, and equity

- Update ranks and prices (normally run model and check prices):

. . .

```p
ranks = pd.read_excel("files/ranks1.xlsx", index_col=0)
ranks = ranks.squeeze()

prices = pd.read_excel("files/prices1.xlsx", index_col=0)
prices = prices.squeeze()
```

- Update portfolio value (normally would update from broker):

. . .

```{.p code-line-numbers="1|2"}
equity = cash + (positions*prices).sum()
weights = (positions*prices) / equity
```

## Sells

. . .

```{.p code-line-numbers="1-2|3|5-6|7|9|10"}
sellall = (ranks>10) & (positions !=0)
sellallamounts = positions
trades = - np.where(sellall, sellallamounts, 0)

sellsome = (ranks<=10) & (weights>0.2)
sellsomeamounts = (equity*(weights-0.2)/prices).astype(int)
trades -= np.where(sellsome, sellsomeamounts, 0)

trades = pd.Series(trades, index=ranks.index)
cash -= (trades*prices).sum()
```


## Buys

- Would like a list of the tickers not currently owned, starting with best stock.  
- Can get it like this:

. . .

```p
tickers = ranks[positions==0].sort_values().index.to_list()
```

- What does tick = tickers.pop(0) do?
  - tick is the first ticker in the list
  - tick is removed from the list (popped off)
- Want to loop over tickers until cash is exhausted.
- Use "while loop": while cash >= ...

#

- while loop:

. . .

```{.p code-line-numbers="1|2|3|4|5"}
while cash >= weight*equity:
    tick = tickers.pop(0)
    trades[tick] = int(weight*equity/prices[tick])
    cash -= trades[tick]*prices[tick]
```

- Spend remaining cash on one more stock.

```{.p code-line-numbers="1|2|3-4|6"}
tick = tickers.pop(0)
trades[tick] = int(cash/prices[tick])
cash -= trades[tick]*prices[tick]

positions += trades
```

#

Here are the trades:

. . .

```{python}
ranks = pd.read_excel("../files/ranks1.xlsx", index_col=0)
ranks = ranks.squeeze()

prices = pd.read_excel("../files/prices1.xlsx", index_col=0)
prices = prices.squeeze()

equity = cash + (positions*prices).sum()
weights = (positions*prices) / equity

sellall = (ranks>10) & (positions !=0)
sellallamounts = positions
sellsome = (ranks<=10) & (weights>0.2)
sellsomeamounts = (equity*(weights-0.2)/prices).astype(int)

trades = - np.where(sellall, sellallamounts, 0)
trades -= np.where(sellsome, sellsomeamounts, 0)
trades = pd.Series(trades, index=ranks.index)

cash -= (trades*prices).sum()

tickers = ranks[positions==0].sort_values().index.to_list()

while cash >= weight*equity:
    tick = tickers.pop(0)
    trades[tick] = int(weight*equity/prices[tick])
    cash -= trades[tick]*prices[tick]

tick = tickers.pop(0)
trades[tick] = int(cash/prices[tick])
cash -= trades[tick]*prices[tick]

positions += trades
trades
```
